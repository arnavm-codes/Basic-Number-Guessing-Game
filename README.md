# Basic-Number-Guessing-Game
## About the Game
### Pretty basic python code, utilising random lib to generate random integer and asking the player to guess it. 
### Gives 5 chances to the player to guess the correct number. After every guess entered, it tells whether the number entered is higher or lower than the correct number.
### Currently single-player but can be updated to multi-player.
## YAML file
### I've used a YAML file for setting up game configrations.
